# JobCard
A jobcard System for Field Engineers
The Safaricom Partners and SLA Team normally follown up on the site contructor works for payment 
according to the agreement on the materials used. 

The Follow up is based on paper work and a member of the team has to follow up to manually check 
on the input values before commiting for payment.

To automate the system, I have come up with this system, where the engineer on site can fill in
the details of the work done online, approved by the contractor together with the safaricom engineer
sending the contractor engineer to the site. 
The reports can be printed from the system by all the groups but limited to the extend based on the 
permissions.
